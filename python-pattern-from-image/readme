to operate, you'll need a RGB image of any size.

run:

python crochetme.py "photo - Copy.png" 2.5 > output.txt

in the same folder. 2.5 is the ratio for resizing

near the bottom of the code is:

WIDTH_LIMIT=59
ROW_BREAK=95

which defines the number of column and number of rows per chunk.

simply redirect to file and load in you favourite text printing,
output includes the work "PAGEBREAK" for easy page breaking
